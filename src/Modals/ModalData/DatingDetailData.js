Just use your first name or create a playful account username and vanity email account with a flirty nickname. Who doesn’t enjoy an air of mystery while you get comfortable with the other person?",

By the same token, don’t link any online dating sites to your social channels. This is one of the fastest ways for someone to trace you and learn all about you, your friends and family.",

It’s an easy way to meet virtually before setting up in-person dates, and also a safe way to spend time together between dates. No need to share your email, phone number or social media handle—just some quality face-to-face time with new friends.

And never feel bad about requesting a new drink if you recognize any suspicious behavior(s) from anyone at or around your table. Date rape drugs are easy to administer and do not change the flavor or appearance of your drink. Keeping an eye on your drink at all times is the best way to stay safe."

If you find yourself always on the move before a date, consider investing in a rechargeable cell phone case or a portable charger to always be prepared. "

Additionally, you may also block the member which will prevent them from communicating with you and from seeing your profile. "
